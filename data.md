<h1 id="hwgh">How we got here</h1>

People have always collected information about themselves, others, and the world around us. More recently, we have developed many tools and devices to help us gather data in any number of ways. The number of variables we can analyze is almost infinite. Using increasingly standardized methods of data gathering allows us to compare variables and show how relationships between many variables change over time.

Science--in the modern sense of the word--uses data as a way of collecting and analyzing evidence. Data allows us to quantitatively compare information from a variety of sources.

<h1 id="pid">Problems in data</h1>

Decreasing costs have increased the feasibility of adding sensors (devices that can collect information) to almost everything. On one hand this could make everything "smarter", but on the other, it creates a lot of mess.

Hardware runs on chips, which contain vulnerabilities. Therefore, as more devices in our everyday lives produce more data to tell us more, we must be aware that we open ourselves up to having our data compromised (= stolen).


<h1 id="wdtfl">Where does the future lead?</h1>

We will see more streams of data: data that never stops changing and updating. Streaming data is not static. It's like a firehose: a constant flow of information. This is important to understand because it means that any feedback is almost instantaneous, but reflects only one instant in time. If you perform the analysis again a moment later, the result may be different.

The job of the future data visualizer will be to deal with this firehose of data and to figure out which parts are important in real time.


<h1 id="eac">Examples and Code</h1>

**D3.js**

![d3]( {{ site.baseurl }}/img/data/d3.png)

Site: [d3js.org](http://d3js.org/)

Github: [github.com/mbostock/d3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3)

D3.js is the visualization library behind many of today's interactive visualizations. It allows for deep control over all final interactions, but is also used as a building block for a number of other data tools.
