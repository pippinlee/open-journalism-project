# Why

This project started as a weekend project to collect many resources in one place.

The goal is to provide a very concise guide for anyone that's curious about understanding what tools and libraries exist for experimenting with telling stories on the web.

It is also an ode to all the open source projects that have been created in hopes of helping journalists tell stories. In talking to many students interested in  journalism one common problem is **exposure** to what is possible.

This site will try to concisely answer *"what is possible"* as well as *"how is this possible"*.

If you're curious to about how you can help with this project, say hey at <a href="mailto:pippin@pippinlee.com?subject=Open Journalism Project">pippin@pippinlee.com</a>

The Open Journalism Project was inspired and stands on the shoulders of Mozilla's OpenNews initiative [Source](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/) and the Knightlab's [Learn](http://learn.knightlab.com/) resource to create a better starting point for those interested in the intersection of journalism and code.
